# Sleep Debt Calculator
## Project #25 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The Sleep Debt Calculator logs how much, or how little, you sleep every week. 
This app recommends 7 hours of sleep daily. The user inputs how many hours they sleep each day of the week (in the switch statement within the getSleepHours() function). The calculateSleepDebt() function logs how many more or less hours the user sleeps than the 7 hours per day recommendation.
## What I Learned
  - Reinforced my understanding of JavaScript functions, operators, and switch statements
  - Assigning functions to variables
